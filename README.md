AdminSim
========
This Graphical User Interface will assist you in setting up and administering your 'owner operated' (Windows) multi instance OpenSim virtual reality system.

AdminSim gets things done easily.

It's suitable for administering OpenSim running in 'grid' mode on a server or home PC and connected to OSGrid (or similiar open grids).

Summary:

It can perform the following 'Tasks' on single or multiple instances:

	Sends console server commands to OpenSim,
	Broadcast Alerts In-World,
	Backup to & restore from Oar, r32 files,
	Be notified of OpenSim upgrades automatically,
	Download and Upgrade to the latest version OpenSims easily,
	Revert (Undo) Upgrades,
	Stop and Start all instances in a single console window (via a single button press),
	Create MySQL databases,
	Configure GidCommon.ini (for database usage with SQLite, SQLiteLegacy and MySQL supported),
	Creates or updates OpenSim setup files; such as 'Start.bat', 'backup.txt', 'restore.txt', 'Fullbackup.txt' (etc).

Additionally:

	No need to customize OSGrid's default OpenSim.ini at each upgrade,
	No need to use an external editor as most common variables can changed in the GUI,
	Easy to setup and use,
	Free...

So download the latest exe file above and install in C:\AdminSim directory.

Prior to performing any 'Tasks' mentioned above, please read the 'Help' screens and then set up AdminSim via the 'Setup' screen so it understands your OpenSim system.
Have fun.
