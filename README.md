AdminSim
========
If you are thinking about or are currently running multiple instances of OpenSim, then this Graphical User Interface may make it easier.

This program will assist you to set up and administer your 'owner operated' (Windows) OpenSim virtual reality system running in 'grid' mode and connected to OSGrid (or similiar open grids).

AdminSim gets things done easily.

Summary:

It can perform the following 'Tasks' on single or multiple instances:

	Sends console server commands to OpenSim,
	Broadcast Alerts In-World,
	Backup to & restore from Oar, r32 files,
	Be notified of OpenSim upgrades automatically,
	Download and Upgrade the latest version OpenSims easily,
	Revert (Undo) Upgrades,
	Stop and Start all instances in a single console window (via a single button press),
	Create MySQL databases,
	Configure GridCommon.ini (for database usage with SQLite, SQLiteLegacy and MySQL supported),
	Creates or updates OpenSim setup files; such as 'Start.bat', 'backup.txt', 'restore.txt', 'Fullbackup.txt' (etc).

Additionally:

	No need to customize OSGrid's default OpenSim.ini at each upgrade,
	No need to use an external editor as most common variables can changed in the GUI,
	Easy to setup and use,
	Free...

So download the latest exe file above and install in C:\AdminSim directory.

Before to performing any 'Tasks' mentioned above, please read the 'Help' screens and then set up AdminSim via the 'Setup' screen so it understands your OpenSim system.
Have fun.
